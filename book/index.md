Protypo is a versatile and powerful Python library designed to facilitate the creation, training, and deployment of cutting-edge language models, a fundamental component in natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI) applications. The name Protypo is derived from the Greek word πρότυπο, meaning "prototype" or "model," reflecting the library's focus on providing a solid foundation for language model development.
